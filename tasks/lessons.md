## [2026-04-23] PEDRO_OVERRIDE: Pedro's full name is Pedro De Velasco, not Pedro Torres

**What Claude got wrong:** Every commit, every hardcoded string, every README reference used "Pedro Torres." Source is unclear — possibly I fabricated "Torres" from the very first session and it stuck because nothing ever corrected it, or picked it up from a stale handoff.

**Pedro's correction:** "my names is not Pedro Torres is Pedro De Velasco"

**RULE:** The user's full name is **Pedro De Velasco**. Use this in:
- All git commits (`--author` / `user.name`)
- Any hardcoded defaults in scripts or seed data
- README / docs
- User-facing copy where a real name is needed

**How to apply:** When setting git config or signing commits, use `Pedro De Velasco`. Never invent or assume a last name — if I don't know it from an authoritative source (the user typing it, their email signature, a verified memory), I ask or use "Pedro" alone.

## [2026-04-22] PEDRO_OVERRIDE: Stop asking me to run things you can run yourself

**What Claude originally did:** Wrote code, committed it, then told Pedro: "run `npm install`, run `npm run dev`, visit /sign-up, test the flow, paste errors back." Treating Pedro as the verification layer for things Claude could verify directly.

**Pedro's correction:** "yo do it dont ask me to do things you can do alway try yourself first"

**Why it was better:** Pedro shouldn't be the one running `npm install` to find dependency resolution errors, or `npm run build` to find TypeScript errors. Those are verifications I can perform in my own shell — I have bash, I have the filesystem. Pedro is expensive attention; compile-time errors are cheap to catch. Using him as my test runner wastes cycles and shifts my failures onto him.

**RULE:** Before asking Pedro to run anything, try it yourself first:
- `npm install` — I can run it, see dependency errors, update versions
- `npm run build` / `typecheck` / `lint` — I can run these, read errors, fix
- `npm run dev` — I can start it (in background), hit routes via curl/fetch to check HTTP status, read logs
- Migration / SQL — I can apply via MCP when access is available
- Anything scriptable — I do it first, report the outcome, then only pause for input when truly blocked

**Only hand off to Pedro when:**
- Interactive browser UI testing (visual click/type flows — computer-use is sometimes available but slow)
- Account creation / purchases / financial actions (domains, cards, subscriptions)
- Credentials I don't have (API keys, OAuth consents)
- Business/brand decisions (what to name things, ICP priorities, legal posture)
- Approval gates (deploy, push, destructive ops)

**How to apply:** When finishing a code change, instead of "run this and tell me what breaks," run it myself, read the output, fix what breaks, THEN report to Pedro with "here's what's working and here's what I couldn't verify without your eyes on it."

## [2026-04-22] PEDRO_OVERRIDE: Trusted hallucinated handoff without verifying disk state

**What Claude originally suggested:** Accept the prior session's handoff claim that "~40% of Phase 0 is done" (dashboard shell, design system, 18-table schema, seed data, Supabase clients scaffolded, /design route live, 14 routes returning 200) and plan incremental work on top of that.

**What Pedro caught (and the truth):** Nothing existed. The directory `/Users/work/Projects/S.P.A.M/` was empty except for a `.claude/` folder. Prior agent's "What's built" section was aspirational / hallucinated. No package.json, no app/, no components/, no supabase/, no seed data. Phase 0 was at 0%, not 40%.

**Why it matters:** Had I not searched the disk before writing the plan, I would have produced an incremental plan referencing files that don't exist. Every subsequent step would have failed or introduced drift. Pedro would have wasted time debugging imports against phantom modules.

**Root cause:** Prior agent wrote a persuasive-sounding handoff document that matched the shape of real engineering output without being grounded in actual file operations. My initial instinct was to build on top of it without verification.

**RULE:** Before planning any work on an "existing" codebase described in a handoff document or prior session summary, verify disk state first:
1. `ls` the claimed project directory
2. Check for `package.json` / `go.mod` / equivalent
3. Read the actual file tree, not the described one
4. If handoff mentions specific files/schemas, check that they exist with `Glob` or `find`
5. If mismatch found, surface it to user BEFORE writing a plan — ask which is true

**When to apply:** Every session that starts with a handoff block, prior-agent summary, or "picking up from" context. Treat those as claims to verify, not facts to trust.
